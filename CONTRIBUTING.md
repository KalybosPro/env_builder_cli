### Key Components

- **Commands**: Handle specific CLI operations (build, encrypt, decrypt)
- **Core**: Contains business logic for parsing, generation, and processing
- **Code Generation**: Uses Envied to create type-safe environment classes
- **Configuration**: Manages package setup and dependency injection

## Development Workflow

### 1. Choose an Issue

- Check [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/KalybosPro/env_builder_cli/issues) for available tasks
- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
- Comment on the issue to indicate you're working on it

### 2. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
# Create and switch to a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/issue-number-description
```

### 3. Make Changes

- Write clear, focused commits
- Follow the [code style guidelines](#code-style)
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

### 4. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run the full test suite
dart test

# Run specific tests
dart test test/specific_test.dart

# Test the CLI manually
dart run bin/env_builder_cli.dart --help
```

### 5. Update Documentation

- Update README.md if adding new features
- Update this CONTRIBUTING.md if changing contribution process
- Add code comments for complex logic

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
dart test

# Run tests with coverage (if configured)
dart test --coverage=coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
dart test --watch
```

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in the `test/` directory
- Name test files with `_test.dart` suffix
- Use descriptive test names
- Cover both positive and negative scenarios
- Test edge cases and error conditions

Example test structure:

```dart
import 'package:test/test.dart';
import 'package:env_builder_cli/env_builder_cli.dart';

void main() {
  group('BuildCommand', () {
    test('should generate env package from single env file', () async {
      // Arrange
      final command = BuildCommand();

      // Act
      final result = await command.run(['--env-file=.env']);

      // Assert
      expect(result, equals(0));
    });
  });
}
```

### Manual Testing

Test your changes manually using the example project:

```bash
cd example

# Test build command
env_builder build --env-file=.env

# Verify generated package
ls -la packages/env/
```

## Code Style

This project follows Dart's official style guide. Key guidelines:

### Dart Style

- Use `dart format` to format code automatically
- Follow [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart) guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Write clear documentation comments

### Code Formatting

```bash
# Format all Dart files
dart format .

# Check formatting without changing files
dart format --set-exit-if-changed .
```

### Linting

```bash
# Run linter
dart analyze

# Fix auto-fixable issues
dart fix --apply
```

### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
feat: add version checking command
fix: handle empty env files in parser
docs: update build command examples
refactor: simplify env file validation logic
```
