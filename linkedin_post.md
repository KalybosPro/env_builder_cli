🚀 Revolutionize environment management in your Flutter apps with env_builder_cli ! 🇺🇸

I'm proud to share this powerful Dart tool that automates the creation and maintenance of environment packages for your Flutter applications. Let's generate type-safe code from .env files with built-in encryption support together!

## 🔄 Automated Environment Package Generation
**Usage:** `env_builder build`
**Useful example:** In your Flutter project, run this command to automatically create a `packages/env` package with Dart classes to access your environment variables in a type-safe manner.

## 🔐 Built-in AES Encryption
**Usage:** `env_builder build --no-encrypt` (to disable) or enabled by default
**Useful example:** Your sensitive API keys like `API_KEY=prod_key_456` are automatically encrypted with AES, making .env files safely committable.

## 📝 Type-Safe Access
**Usage:** Using classes generated by Envied
**Useful example:**
```dart
final EnvValue env = AppFlavor.production().getEnv;

String get baseUrl => env(Env.baseUrl);
```
No more runtime type errors!

## 🏗️ Seamless Flutter Integration
**Usage:** Automatic via `flutter pub get`
**Useful example:** The env package is automatically added to your pubspec.yaml dependencies

## 🔄 Multi-Environment Support
**Usage:** `env_builder build --env-file=.env.development,.env.production`
**Useful example:** Easily manage development, staging, production with distinct .env.development, .env.production, etc. files.

## 📂 Git Integration
**Usage:** Automatic during build
**Useful example:** .gitignore is automatically updated to exclude your sensitive .env files but include .env.encrypted ones.

## 🧪 Testing Support
**Usage:** Tests generated automatically
**Useful example:** Validate your environment variables with unit tests generated for each .env file.

## 🎨 Asset Encryption
**Usage:** `env_builder assets --encrypt=aes`
**Useful example:** Encrypt and embed your images, videos, and SVGs directly in Dart code. Perfect for protecting your sensitive resources!

## 📱 APK/AAB Build with Obfuscation
**Usage:** `env_builder apk` or `env_builder aab`
**Useful example:** Automatic release build with obfuscation to secure your Flutter code in production.

## 🔒 Encrypt/Decrypt Commands
**Usage:** `env_builder encrypt --password=key .env`
**Useful example:** Encrypt your sensitive .env files locally or in your CI/CD.

## 📦 Embedded Assets (Zero Dependencies)
**Usage:** `env_builder assets`
**Useful example:** Your assets become Uint8List constants in the code, no need for pubspec.yaml!

```dart
// With pre-built widgets
Assets.images.logo.image(), // Image widget
```
